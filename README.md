# Box3 - Dev VM Penetration Testing Walkthrough Training (TCM Sec)

1. Network scanning
- Scan the network to get target IP Address (still not understand how this will be used when there's a lot of other user in the same network to make sure we don't target the wrong victim)
!<nmap-scan-network.png>
- Scan the target IP Address
!<nmap-scan-target.png>
Available ports and services:
- 22(ssh) -> OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
- 80/8080(http) -> Apache https 2.4.38 (Debian)
- 111(rcpbind) -> 2-4 (RPC #100000)
- 2049(nfs_acl) -> 3 (RPC #100227)
- 40637, 43461, 43827 (mountd) -> 1-3 (RPC #1000005)
- 44185(nlockmgr) -> 1-4 (RPC #100021)

2. (Vulnerabilities) information gathering of services
- Failure installation of bolt on the server
!<bolt-web.png>
- Possible entry point from `rpcbind`: [RPCBind Pentesting](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-rpcbind)
- System information from port 8080
!<system-info.png>
- Open file sharing network on port `2049 nfs_acl` and there are several mounted system there.

3. Port 80 and 8080 Directory Busting with ffuf
!<ffuf>
**Port 80 result:**
- src (301) - Directories
- app (301) - Directories
- vendor (301) - Directories
- extensions (301) - Directories
- server-status (403 -Forbidden)

**Port 8080 result:**
- dev (301) - Boltwire setup page
- server-status (403 - Forbidden)

4. At the same time ffuf running, see the mounted file on that IP Address: `showmount -e <target ip address>`
!<showmount.png>
Get: path to the shared files
- Create a directory to mount to that shared folder
!<mount-dir.png>
- Mount the newly created directory to the shared folder
!<mount-dir2.png>

5. Look through the file inside the shared folder
- Unzipping the file
!<unzip.png>
Notice that the zip folder contains 2 file: `id_rsa` and `todo.txt`
- Brute force the zip password with `frackzip`
!<unzip2.png>
- Open the zip folder using the obtained password
!<unzip3.png>
Get: `id_rsa` key and `todo.txt`. Seems like the `id_rsa` can be used as key to connect via SSH.
!<ssh>
However, it asks for password which is not known yet.

6. Looking for config file that is assumed to be correct by the owner
- Find it inside /app directory
!<config.png>
- Look inside the config file
!<config2.png>
Get: Credentials for something!\
driver: sqlite\
databasename: bolt\
username: bolt\
password: I_love_java\

7. Look around boltwire website
- There's login page, try out the combination
!<boltwire-homepage.png>
- There's registration page, try register using the credentials
- !<boltwire.png>
- Notice the url change, try out admin id
!<boltwire-admin.png>

8. Look for reported vulnerabilities of boltwire page
- Get: [Recent Boltwire - Local File Inclusion](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48411)
- Try it out in the boltwire after **LOGIN**
